			<h1>What is a Pokeball?</h1>

		<p align="justify">The Pokeball is a special ball designed for catching and storing Pokemons, therefore greatly reducing the impracticality of having to carry your loyal pokemon everywhere you go. Later on, as science grow more and more advanced, new pokeball types are invented. Now, Poke balls has become ubiquitous in the pokemon world, with every trainer carrying at least one, or six for the maximum number of Poke Balls that are permitted to be carried by a trainer. Because of that, pokeballs have practically became the symbol of anything pokemon-related. Appearing in Pokemon Centers, PokeMarts, and many pokemon contests across the world.</p>

			<h1>History of Pokeball</h1>
		</div>
		<p align="justify">The first Poke Ball is invented in the Johto Region, Where Apricons grow. It is invented to allow trainers to capture and train pokemon safely without major risks. As before, capturing and training a pokemon (like Primeape) can produce fatal injuries and even death. These fruit are then cut and carved out, than is fitted with a special device for capturing. Nowadays, Pokeballs no longer use apricons, and are being mass-produced by Silph Co. in Kanto, the Devon Corporation in Hoenn, and the Kalos Pokeball Factory. Although now mass-produced, some trainers still carry pokeballs made out from Apricons and Kurt in Azalea Town still makes them. The Encyclopedia Pokemonica and The Pokemon Daisuki Club both say that Pokeballs are invented in 1925, but newer discoveries from ghost ships suggest that pokeballs are made from as far as 300 years ago. </p>
		<p align="justify">Pokeballs also greatly effect the name Pokemon that are used today. Prior to the Pokeball invention, Pokemons are called magical creatures. Hence the name Pokemon, short of Pocket Monster, is predicted to emerge at the same time with the invention of pokeball. <br> <br></p>
